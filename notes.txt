2. Add component lifecycle support to virtual-dom

3. Add view-model support to components

4. Explain the problems with React in detail.  High level:
	-React's handling of state is totally wrong
	-React's shouldComponentUpdate is totally wrong
	-React encourages spagehetti code / a lack of domain modeling
	-React is oddly hard to test (this shouldn't be the case whatsoever)
	-Two sources of truth: props vs state
	-Unable to inherit even when it makes sense
	-A component's children shouldn't always be opaque.  Sometimes you know the types of children you can take and should be able to take actions on those children based on their type.
	-The problem of where to place a component's logic.  The splitting of things into mixins and the need for parents to know things they shouldn't / things that should be handled internally to their children.
